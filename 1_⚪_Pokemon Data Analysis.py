multi_type = '''### Type I and Type I/II

A small inference about the pie chart depicting Pok√©mon with one type versus those 
with two types based on generations could reveal an interesting trend. 
For instance, it might show that in earlier generations, 
there was a higher prevalence of Pok√©mon with only one type, 
indicating simpler designs or gameplay mechanics. 


Conversely, in later generations, there could be a more balanced 
distribution or even a slight increase in Pok√©mon with two types, 
reflecting a desire for more complexity and diversity in Pok√©mon 
designs and battles as the franchise evolved.
